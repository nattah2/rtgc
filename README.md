`tb_gc`.
Toy implementation of an allocator and garbage collector in C, intended as an experiment in real-time systems. It is highly advisable that you do not use for anything serious, and it's likely in your best interest to not reference it either. I plan on improving it over time as my understanding grows. 

For more information about garbage collectors and other areas related to this project, see [doc/main.org](doc/main.org).

The `tb` stands for "Trailblazer".
